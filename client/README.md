**Goal of the project:** enable people to add domains, scrap URL and SD from each domain. 

I am doing versions so that it feels like I am making progress. 

**Version 1:** Enable a user to add a domain. List Domains. Install react routers so that each domain has its own page.

**Version 2:** Enable a user to scrape a certain number of URLs from a domain. Show the scrapped domains.

**Version 3:** Enable a user to scrape SDs from the URLs. Show the scrapped SD in a coherent and user friendly way.
